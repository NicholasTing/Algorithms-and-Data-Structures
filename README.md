# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Purpose

After my recent technical interview at Google and Facebook, I have decided to further increase my knowledge on algorithms and data structures to improve and quicken my ability to solve problems efficiently :zap:.

In order to do so, I actively attend the Monash Competitive Programming Club, under Coach Darcy Best :star:, and have learnt a lot of new concepts that I have not even heard of during my time at university.

Under the advice of Coach Darcy, I aim to solve as many Codeforces problems as I can, from most solved to least solved :muscle:.

As of the creation of this repository, I have solved over <strong>500</strong> problems on [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com).
